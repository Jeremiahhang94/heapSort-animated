Heap Sort With Animation

A simple illustration of Heap Sort doing it's magic. 

Having holidays now and decided to self-learn some programming skills and happened to read up on sorting algorithms. Thought it would have been more fun if I actually made it animate. Really hope to expand on this codes and to really learn how I can further expand on my skills.

Future plans:

Comparision of different other sorting algorithms
